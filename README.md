## About

My website is generated with [Lume](https://lume.land), which runs on
[Deno](https://deno.land). The site used to be a fork of
[11r](https://github.com/reeseschultz/11r), but the trappings and quirks of the
Node/NPM ecosystem became unbearably annoying for this particular dev ‚ö∞Ô∏è. While
[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), used by 11r, is a great solution that is
lightyears ahead of most static site generators, Lume is even more so. Find out
for yourself.

One reason for this site being open source is so you can fork it. That said,
it's opinionated. You'll notice these choices:

- Templating with [Pug](https://pugjs.org) (it's terse)
- Styling with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for convenience
- Syntax highlighting via [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org)
- Code copying made simple with [clipboard.js](https://highlightjs.org)
- Inclusion of a
  [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)-based
  game called `jongler`
- No other JavaScript required for significant content
- Occasional disregard for W3C spec because its rigidity impedes upon the free
  market
- RSS-like [JSON feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org) support since that should be a
  thing
- No creepy analytics

## Running 

### With Deno
1. Get [Deno](https://deno.land)
1. `cd` to local clone or fork
1. `deno task serve`

### With Docker Compose
1. Get [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
1. `cd` to local clone or fork

## Deploying
1. Get [Deno](https://deno.land)
1. `cd` to local clone or fork
1. `deno run --allow-all --unstable deploy.ts`

`deploy.ts` is hard-coded for deploying my website to GitHub Pages‚Äîyou'll want
to modify it for your purposes, along with configuration and metadata. And
remember to replace the content!

## Configuring
- `src/_data.yml` file for customizing general data across the site.
- `src/blog` folder for the blog content.
