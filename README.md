## About

My website is generated with [Lume](https://lume.land), which runs on
[Deno](https://deno.land).

This site is open source mainly so you can fork it to use with your own content. That said,
it's opinionated. You'll notice these choices:

- Templating with [Pug](https://pugjs.org) (it's terse)
- Styling with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for convenience
- Syntax highlighting via [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org)
- Code copying made simple with [clipboard.js](https://highlightjs.org)
- Inclusion of a
  [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)-based
  game called `jongler`
- No other JavaScript required for significant content
- Occasional disregard for W3C spec because its rigidity impedes upon the free
  market
- RSS-like [JSON feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org) support since that should be a
  thing
- No creepy analytics
